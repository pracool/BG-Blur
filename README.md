# BG-Blur
A simple yet effective way to blur background in images using watershed algorithm.

First the background portion is selected using watershed algortithm , where the red marks are marked on the background portion of the image and green marks are for foreground portion.

One can easily switch between red and green marks by pressing "1" or "2" on keyboard.

The size of marker can be adjusted using "+" and "-" buttons to mark boundaries precisely.

Presing "C" resets the segment.
